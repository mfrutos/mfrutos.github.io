Welcome to our multi-part blog series where we will design and build a superheterodyne transceiver entirely from scratch over the next year. This project is aimed at amateur radio enthusiasts, electronics hobbyists, and students of electrical engineering who want to gain a deep understanding of radio design by developing a working transceiver themselves.

In terms of tools, readers will need basic equipment like a multimeter for circuit debugging and general voltage measurements. An oscilloscope will be useful for examining signal waveforms at different points in the design. We'll also use a signal generator for injecting test tones into the RF front-end. For power supplies, we'll look at using affordable benchtop units or building our own regulated supplies whenever possible to keep costs down. 

The superhet principle revolutionized radio by moving signals down to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) band before detection, which allowed for improved selectivity compared to previous tuner designs. Over the next series of posts, we will trace the entire process - from choosing operating frequencies to meet regulations, developing oscillator and filter circuits, constructing RF and IF amplifier stages, designing detectors and automatic gain control, adding audio circuits, and ultimately integrating everything together into complete transmitting and receiving systems.  

By the end of this project, followers will have gained hands-on experience in analog and RF circuit design, construction techniques, and an in-depth understanding of how communications receivers operate from antenna to audio. No prior experience is required beyond basic electronics knowledge.

In terms of budget, readers can expect to invest between EUR200-EUR300 for all the necessary components over the course of the multi-part build. Higher-end components may increase costs slightly. All parts will be sourced online through readily available suppliers.

I hope you'll join us on this journey back to basics as we literally build this transceiver layer by layer from the ground up. Let's get started with our first post on choosing operating frequencies.
